Clang2Dot
=========

I am working with Clang, basically transforming Clang AST to another (Sage III
from ROSE Compiler).

To do this, I first had to understand how to instantiate the compiler, then what
Clang AST look like.

I think that I will share the result of this work. If you have try something
similar you may have notice that most tutorial are out of date. This code is
out-of-date too as I am using LLVM/Clang version 3.0 (even if 3.1 is already out).
